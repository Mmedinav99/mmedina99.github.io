    <h2>The Origins</h2>
    <p>The <strong>cacao tree</strong> (Theobroma cacao) is native to Central and South America. As early as 1900 BC, cocoa beans were used by ancient cultures like the Olmecs.</p>

    <h3>Used by Ancient Civilizations</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Mayans and Aztecs</strong> highly valued cocoa. It was made into a bitter, spiced drink and even used as currency. The Aztecs referred to cocoa as <em>"food of the gods."</em></p>

    <p>After being introduced to Europe in the 16th century, cocoa became a luxury enjoyed sweetened with sugar. It quickly gained popularity and evolved into what we now know as chocolate.</p>
