        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Summit Farms is recognized for rescuing Alaskan dog breeds such as Malamutes and Huskies. Our mission is to adopt and save as many dogs as we can.</p>
        <p>We believe in helping the helpless and reducing the number of homeless dogs while improving the welfare of all domestic animals. Additionally, we seek to educate our community on the plight of these animals.</p>
        <p>Since the founding of Summit Farms, we have adopted more than 2,620 dogs and counting.</p>
        <p>We are grateful for the continued support of our donors and overjoyed to see so many huskies find new forever homes with caring families.</p>
