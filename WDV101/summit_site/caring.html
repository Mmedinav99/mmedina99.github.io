        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Alaskan dog breeds are intelligent and energetic. Positive reinforcement and consistent training methods work best. Early socialization helps them adapt well to families and other pets.</p>

      <section class="care-section">
        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>These breeds have thick double coats that shed heavily twice a year. Regular brushing (at least once or twice weekly) reduces shedding and keeps their coat healthy. Bathing should be done occasionally.</p>

      <section class="care-section">
        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>Regular veterinary check-ups are important. Common health issues include hip dysplasia and eye conditions, so screening is recommended. Keep vaccinations and parasite control up to date.</p>

      <section class="care-section">
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Alaskan dogs are active and need a balanced diet rich in protein and nutrients. Consult your vet for breed-specific dietary recommendations. Fresh water should always be available.</p>
